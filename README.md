Idea: 
1) Which US-counties are most affected by Covid-19 relating to infections and deaths? 
2) What are the social vulnerability factors in those counties? 
3) Is there a correlation between social vulnerability factors and Covid-19 cases?
4) Is there a correlation between social vulnerability factors and Covid-19 deaths? 

Hypothesis: Yes, there is.
